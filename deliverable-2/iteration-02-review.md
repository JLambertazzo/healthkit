## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 4 March, 2022
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
1. Automatic deployment on push/pull-request
    * Allows developers to focus on developing and not how to deploy the code on every update
1. Branching system & two-way pull requests
    * Has helped us to avoid major merge issues between contributions
1. Weekly meetings at 7pm
    * Finding a time when our whole team was available every week helped us keep communicating and keep each other updated
1. Organize with team notion
    * Having a single central place for all important info was helpful 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
1. Meetings held online
    * Meetings were very casual and did not involve much discussion/planning
1. Once a week communication
    * Was not regular enough to stay on task


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
1. More in person meetings/meetups
    * Will be nice to spend time together in person for project meetings and just social team meetings
1. More frequent communication
    * To make sure we are staying on task and regularly engaging with the project


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

Our demo was done over zoom, showing our deployed development branch which was our most up-to-date version. We demoed the implemented front-end pages as described by our mock-up. Our partner was happy to see the progress and the features and we discussed that this project is headed in the right direction. No changes were requested as of now. We learned of some special functionality of the forms of which we were not aware of previously for us to keep in mind while building the forms part of our app.
