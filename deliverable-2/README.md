# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
 
This application at its core is a form that is specialized to evaluate the abilities of hospitals to be able to care for patients. This particular use case by the Boston Children’s Hospital is to measure the pediatric emergency care capacities of different hospitals, but this app can be generalized for other use cases. The app allows an end-user to create these massive questionnaires/surveys and distribute them out to the relevant people. Then these end-users will be able to complete the form questions concurrently. After the form has been completed, the end users will be able to generate a report that details how well equipped the hospitals are. 
  
One of the challenges that the hospital faced was the issue of multiple people having to complete the massive form/survey. Currently with the tools that they have, they would have to all get together for a 3 hour meeting with all pertinent staff members and painstakingly complete the survey. Another issue that arises is when this form needs to be completed by a hospital overseas. Then it becomes arduous to try to coordinate with all members to complete the form. This is clearly unideal and our tool aims to solve that problem by allowing all end-user’s to concurrently access their relevant sections of the survey at the same time. 

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
An end user will first sign up through the sign up page, inputting their email address, username and password. After entry of these fields, the user’s account will be created and they will immediately be directed to their dashboard. On their dashboard, they will see all the current forms that they are a part of. Under the “My Forms” tab, the user will be able to see the forms that they have created under the “Created Forms” section and the forms that they have been invited to work on under the “Sent Forms” section. When a user creates a form, they will be able to invite others to work on the form by sending an email invite or by link. Any user who is able to work on a form will also be able to invite others within their affiliation/group to also access the form. A user will be able to answer questions in any form they have been invited to and once the survey has been fully completed, the user will be able to click on the results button to generate a readable format summarizing the data collected from the forms.   
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
